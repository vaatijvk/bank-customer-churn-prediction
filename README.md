Project Synopsis:

The primary goal of the Bank Customer Churn Prediction project is to forecast whether or not bank customers will quit the bank by analyzing their demographic and financial data, which includes things like age, gender, credit score, nation, balance, and more. The decision of a client to quit a bank, known as customer churn, can have a big effect on the operations and profitability of the bank. The bank can take proactive steps to keep important clients and raise customer satisfaction by precisely anticipating customer attrition.
 
 Concerning the Dataset:
This project uses a 10,000 row, 14 column dataset that was obtained via Kaggle. The main goal of the dataset is to forecast, using a customer's financial and demographic information, if they would churn, or quit the bank.
